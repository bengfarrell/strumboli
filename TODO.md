- make web only version work
- create driver file for Zynthian for driver-loaded devices (key input won't work here, which means the buttons won't work without a driver)
- host web only version and find out if websocket version can work from host rather than packaging it and including http server
- create web based device detector - possibly have a flavor with websockets to run from any device
